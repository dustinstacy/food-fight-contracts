// A Dex contract that will allow users to exchange one currency for another based on the Uniswap V2 protocol.

// The exchange rate will be determined by the contract, and users can specify how much of the currency they want to exchange.

// The contract will need to ensure that the user has enough of the currency they want to exchange, and that the exchange
// is valid based on the Uniswap V2 protocol.

// The contract will also need to handle the exchange of the currencies, and update the user's balances accordingly.

// The contract will also need to emit events for successful exchanges, and handle any errors that may occur during the
// exchange process.

// The contract will also need to be able to handle multiple currencies, and allow users to exchange between any two currencies
// that are supported by the Uniswap V2 protocol.

// The contract will also need to ensure IGC can be exchanged for other currencies, and that the exchange rate is fair and accurate
// based on the Uniswap V2 protocol.

// The contract will also need to be able to handle large exchanges, and ensure that the exchange process is efficient and secure.

// The contract will also need to be able to handle multiple users exchanging currencies at the same time, and ensure that the exchange
// process is fair and transparent for all users.
