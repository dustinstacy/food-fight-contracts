// A Set of governance contracts that will allow the community to vote on improvements to the protocol.

// The DAO will be able to vote on proposals to change the protocol, and the proposals will be executed if they reach a quorum of votes.

// These contracts will be responsible for distrubiting and making avaialable governance tokens to the community.

// Using these tokens, voting power will be distributed to the community, and the community will be able to vote on proposals to change the protocol.

// Users will also be able to delegate their voting power to other users, and the delegated users will be able to vote on their behalf.

// Standard DAO safety measures will be implemented, such as timelocks and voting periods, to ensure that the community has time to review and vote on proposals.
